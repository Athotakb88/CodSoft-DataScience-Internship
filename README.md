# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using Machine Learning techniques.
The model is trained on the Kaggle Titanic dataset.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, and fare.

##Dataset Information
Dataset Name: Titanic Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Total Records: 891 passengers
Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

🔑 Features Used

Pclass – Passenger class
Sex – Gender
Age – Passenger age
SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses
Parch – Number of parents/children
Fare – Ticket fare

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

**  ##Machine Learning Algorithms**

The following models were implemented and evaluated:
-Logistic Regression
-Decision Tree Classifier
-Random Forest Classifier

## Steps Performed
1. Dataset loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Handling missing values
4. Feature encoding
5. Train-test split
6. Model training (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree)
7. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix


   ## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab
3. Upload the dataset (train.csv)
4. Run all cells sequentially


## Repository Contents
titanic_survival.ipynb – Complete Google Colab notebook
train.csv – Dataset file
README.md – Project documentation

## Result
The trained model successfully predicts passenger survival with reasonable accuracy.
