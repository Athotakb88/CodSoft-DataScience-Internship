# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using Machine Learning techniques.
The model is trained on the Kaggle Titanic dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Dataset loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Handling missing values
4. Feature encoding
5. Train-test split
6. Model training (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree)
7. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

## Result
The trained model successfully predicts passenger survival with reasonable accuracy.
